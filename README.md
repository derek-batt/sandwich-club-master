# Sandwich Club Project 

## Project Overview
In this project, I completed the **Sandwich Club** app to
show the details of each sandwich once it is selected.

## Why this Project

Building a layout and populating its fields from data received as JSON
is a common task for Android Developers. Although JSON parsing is usually
done using libraries, writing the JSON parsing for  this project
helped me to better understand how it is processed.

## What I Learned
Through this project, I
- Learned how to submit projects to GitHub for review
- Practiced JSON parsing to a model object
- Designed an activity layout
- Populated all fields in the layout accordingly

## How I Completed this Project
Designed the layout for the detail activity so the different elements
display in a sensible way. Implemented the JSON parsing in JsonUtils so it
produced a Sandwich Object that can be used to populate the UI that I designed.
